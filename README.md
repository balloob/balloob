I am Paulus Schoutsen and I work on privacy focused smart homes. I do this by building [Home Assistant]. I started the project in 2013 and now it's one of the most active open source projects in the world! Besides that I also work on [ESPHome], [ESP Web Tools], [Improv Wi-Fi] and more.

My work evolves mainly around keeping the many running. Reviewing contributions, working on the core architecture, documentation and fixing bugs.

If you enjoy what I am doing and want to support my effort, consider [subscribing to Nabu Casa](https://www.nabucasa.com) or [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/balloob)!
