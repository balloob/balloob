I am Paulus Schoutsen and I work on privacy focused smart homes. I do this by building [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io). I started the project 7 years ago and now it's the largest open source home automation platform powering smart homes worldwide!

My work evolves mainly around keeping the many Home Assistant projects running. Reviewing contributions, working on the core architecture, documentation and fixing bugs in Home Assistant and the many projects that we depend on.

If you enjoy what I am doing and want to support my effort, consider [subscribing to Nabu Casa](https://www.nabucasa.com) or [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/balloob)!
